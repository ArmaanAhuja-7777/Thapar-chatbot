Science and Technology Entrepreneur's Park was established as a joint venture between the National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board (NSTEDB), Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India and Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology (TIET) in April 2005, the Science and Technology Entrepreneur’s Park (STEP) at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology is a Centre for Business Incubation that has emerged as a nursery for entrepreneurs and a launch pad for MSMEs. STEP is playing the role of a catalyst for change in the MSME sector by tapping new business opportunities through commercialisation and transfer of technology. Focusing on the domains of agri-biotechnology, biofertilisers, bio-pesticides, mushroom cultivation, plant tissue culture, food processing technology, soy processing and spirulina production technology, STEP has successfully incubated 25 companies, out of which 10 have started their own ventures. It has conducted 76 entrepreneurship development programmes and 16 farmers’ meets since its inception, in the process providing hands-on training to hundreds of people, including students of various reputed institutes, teachers, researchers, farmers, NGOs, entrepreneurs and industrialists. After exiting STEP, they remain attached for consultancy and other services like lab facility. While most business incubation centers focus on research and training, pilot-scale trials and process and product development, the one at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology goes a step ahead by aiding the incubatees in commercialization of technology, seeking constant feedback on the results achieved by them to ensure incubator sustenance as a confidence-building measure and encouraging business-oriented research in the area of agro-biotechnology. These initiatives are aimed at turning the trainees into technopreneurs and agripreneurs. While the registration fee for participants is Rs 1,000 for six months, they do not have to bear any initial expenses on plant and machinery, so the risk is minimised. All they are required to pay for is the actual operational cost. STEP has established linkages with many government institutions and NGOs to facilitate co-business incubation in different areas of intervention, especially to create more entrepreneurial opportunities and commercialise technologies for efficient transfer of innovation and ideas to the industry. It is a member of the ISBA (Indian STEPs and Business Incubators Association), APIN (Asia Pacific Incubators Network) and Patiala Management Association (PMA). The focus of STEP at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology is Business Incubation, Entrepreneurship Education, Consultancy, Training and Mentoring.

The Department of Atomic Energy has handpicked a Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology scientist to work on nuclear fusion programme in collaboration with experts from the department's Institute of Plasma Research. Dr. Rana Pratap Yadav of the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, has been awarded a research grant of Rs 34.35 lakh to improvise on a device that uses electromagnetic fields to produce fusion energy for generating electricity. The magnetic fusion device, "Tokamak", has been a focus for extensive research worldwide, and will emerge as the energy option of the future by 2050. "Tokamak" aims at determining the economic and technological viability of using fusion energy to greater effect to produce electricity. Elaborating on his research project, Dr. Yadav said: "Replicating the fusion reaction, which powers the sun, where two light atomic nuclei of deuterium and tritium are fused to form a heavier atom of helium, requires a phenomenally high temperature of 110 million degrees Celsius. This fusion reaction can be experimentally achieved in a "Tokamak", which attains this temperature through various methods of heating and uses magnetic fields to contain the hot deuterium-tritium plasma. I am specifically working on the Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency (ICRF) heating method, which is very promising." Dr. Yadav will develop a high-powered mock-up ICRF system to demonstrate the technique.

The Department of Atomic Energy has handpicked a Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology scientist to work on nuclear fusion programme in collaboration with experts from the department's Institute of Plasma Research. Dr. Rana Pratap Yadav of the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala, has been awarded a research grant of Rs 34.35 lakh to improvise on a device that uses electromagnetic fields to produce fusion energy for generating electricity. The magnetic fusion device, "Tokamak", has been a focus for extensive research worldwide, and will emerge as the energy option of the future by 2050. "Tokamak" aims at determining the economic and technological viability of using fusion energy to greater effect to produce electricity. Elaborating on his research project, Dr. Yadav said: "Replicating the fusion reaction, which powers the sun, where two light atomic nuclei of deuterium and tritium are fused to form a heavier atom of helium, requires a phenomenally high temperature of 110 million degrees Celsius. This fusion reaction can be experimentally achieved in a "Tokamak", which attains this temperature through various methods of heating and uses magnetic fields to contain the hot deuterium-tritium plasma. I am specifically working on the Ion Cyclotron Resonance Frequency (ICRF) heating method, which is very promising." Dr. Yadav will develop a high-powered mock-up ICRF system to demonstrate the technique.

Producing world class engineers by imparting quality education has been a priority for Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology. However, these Engineers operate in ‘human organizations’ requiring effective communication, appropriate behaviour, good interpersonal skills, problem solving & decision making skills and an understanding of global work environment. It was against this background that management realized that one of the thrust areas should be to nurture a vision to ‘transform students into employable, future ready, global resources’ and conceptualized the need for an initiative to train students with respect to the above mentioned skills, collectively branded as ‘Smart Skills’. Such an initiative would serve a dual purpose: ‘Centre for Training & Development (CTD)’ was thus set up in May 2015 under the aegis of Honorable Director, Professor. Prakash Gopalan, and Officer on Special Duty, Mr. Chiranjiv Singh. The Centre has been entrusted with the responsibility of facilitating students to ‘transition from campus to workplace’, and is operationally represented by Mr. Sanmeet Sidhu, Head-Training.

In this paper, a novel technique is presented for the detection of QRS complex in the ECG signal. Due to time-varying (non-stationary) nature of ECG, the QRS detectors are unable to detect the R-peaks accurately. The qualitative and quantitative analysis has shown remarkable performance as compared to other state-of-the-art methods by achieving an error rate of 0.03%. Also, the proposed method has shown much better results for detecting the R-peak of unclassifiable beats which normally, is missed by QRS detectors reported in literature.

Dr. Gupta’s research interests are in the area of process modeling and simulation. He has collaborative partnerships for research in the areas of FCC modeling, RD modeling, heterogeneous kinetics and reactor design, CO2 adsorption, heat transfer enhancement, RTD modeling of industrial systems, low cost membranes, waste-water treatment, source apportionment of air pollutants. The modeling aspects of FCC process are quite complex. The various works reported on different aspects of this process are required to be included and assessed in detailed models. CFD models with UDFs are to be assessed for their predictive abilities and design improvements. RD (reactive distillation) offers many economic advantages over the conventional reaction step followed by distillation. RD and RDWC can save lot of energy and equipment cost in industrial applications. However, there are design complexities. For these processes, user­defined models are needed to accurately predict the process behavior. Modeling the kinetics of heterogeneous solid catalyzed reactions and estimation of the kinetic parameters. In certain situations, like, in a slurry reactor, two immiscible liquid phases come into existence after some initial reaction time. Modeling of the kinetics of such reactions and predictions of rate constants is important for suitable reactor design. Heat transfer studies in modular heat exchanger configurations (conical, semi­circular). Conical configurations are expected to give more heat transfer than the straight tube heat exchangers due to secondary flow, but at the expense of more pressure drop. Semi­circular heat exchanger configurations are attractive options as the size of heat exchanger becomes compact requiring less space and material and useful for novel designs. The heat transfer studies from such configuration would help in developing such novel heat exchangers. RTD measurement using radio­tracers, and diagnosing the anomalies in the process equipment in industrial and lab scale operations. The RTD concept can be used for fault diagnosis of the industrial equipment in real time without the need of shut­downs, which causes production loss. Modeling the CO2 adsorption on tailored adsorbents. The adsorbents work on the principle that CO2 is weak acid that can be trapped onto a solid modified to have a tailored pore structure to create a large surface area for capturing CO2. Mathematical models can be used to predict fixed­bed adsorption. Modeling source apportionment for particulate matter in ambient air and the effect of crop residue burning (CRB) on air quality. Receptor models are extensively used for quantification of source contribution. Chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model consists of a solution to linear equations that express each receptor chemical concentration as a linear sum of products of source profile abundances and source contributions.

Name of Faculty: Dr. Karun Verma, Associate Professor, CSED Utility:Weed detection and its treatment. This project encompasses several components and achieves a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3 by effectively addressing the issue of weed identification in the agricultural domain. The developed platform is meticulously engineered to minimize the labor-intensive and time-consuming aspects associated with conventional weed management practices. The initial study focuses on the collection of multispectral and RGB data from a rice field, encompassing crops, weeds, and disease data. As part of the analysis, various vegetation indices are computed and examined for both healthy crops and identified weeds present in the field. A successful outcome of this study involves the creation of weed maps using supervised learning techniques applied to aerial imagery of the field, with accuracy assessment based on ground data collection. The weed identification system is conceived through the collection of RGB and multispectral samples of weeds and crops in rice fields. Visual features of the weeds are extracted from the collected RGB samples and multispectral signatures, which are then utilized to train a YoloV5-based system capable of distinguishing weeds from healthy crops. Additionally, the Lincoln beetroot dataset is utilized to further train the weed identification system. The system undergoes successful accuracy testing, with weeds being identified with an 80% confidence level. The technology can be further enhanced and adapted to improve the classification accuracies of the models by incorporating additional data. Furthermore, this weed identification technology can be implemented on a semi-autonomous vehicle designed to systematically scan entire fields planted with row crops. The purpose of this vehicle is to identify weeds and administer precise treatments in-situ while scanning the field.

The “New Directions Program” run by TCD aims at enhancing the research quotient of the Institute as one of its key thrust areas. In alignment with this larger goal, it is imperative for the faculty to conduct qualitative research that would lead to industry application. The journey from research to innovation requires an in-depth understanding of patents and patent filing process. In light of the above, Sanmeet Sidhu, Head - Centre for Training & Development (CTD),organized a one day workshop (March 18th, 2017)for faculty 29 members on ‘Patents and Guide to Patent Process’. The workshop was conducted by consultants from Global Institute of Intellectual Property, a leading organization providing consultancy and training in the domain of Intellectual Property Rights. In his opening address Patrick Collins, VP- OD & Talent Management (Avantha Group) & Head of Human Resources (TIET) underlined the importance of understanding Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) with specific reference to patents and copyrights in the education sector. The workshop addressed the policies underlying the protection of Intellectual Property (IP) and compared the different ways Institutions and individuals could benefit by protecting different forms of IP. Participants were made to appreciate patent specific terminology, laws & acts governing them, associated filing & registration procedures and protection strategies. The inputs were supplemented with important case laws & case studies. All the participants were certified by the Dean of Research & Sponsored Projects. The Institute has embarked on a journey of investing in its most key resource – Human Capital. The “New Directions Program” run by Trinity College, Dublin is an initiative towards this larger goal and it has been designed to deliver research inspired and outcome based educational experience to students. All this spells major “change” in culture, academic and personal spheres of all the stakeholders at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology. To this end the Sanmeet Sidhu, Head - Centre for Training & Development organized atwo day workshop (March 16th & 17th, 2017)for 37 members on ‘Emotional Intelligence During Change’. The workshop was conducted by consultants from InspireOne | TMI, a leading Leadership and Organization consulting company. In his opening address Patrick Collins, VP- OD & Talent Management (Avantha Group) & Head of Human Resources (TIET) emphasized that understanding change and how to cope with it is key to success during periods of uncertainty and turmoil. Further he accentuated that any change once understood,, one starts engaging better and contributing more actively, thus accelerating the pace of change. To ride the change wave successfully one needs to develop competencies related to emotional & social intelligence, which is measured by EQ (Emotional Quotient). The use of the Personal EQ Meter Tool was an important starting point in making the participants get a better understanding about their Self Awareness, Self Management, Internal Motivation, Empathy and Social Skills.

Dr. Saurabh Bhardwaj Professor Specialization Statistical and machine learning based solutions for the problems which involves recognition, classification, clustering, modeling, estimation and information retrieval Email saurabh.bhardwaj@thapar.edu Statistical and machine learning based solutions for the problems which involves recognition, classification, clustering, modeling, estimation and information retrieval saurabh.bhardwaj@thapar.edu https://sites.google.com/site/saurabhshomeonweb/ Biography I have been teaching and conducting research for around 21 years. Currently, I am an Associate Professor in the Electrical and Instrumentation Engineering Department at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, India. In addition, I hold the title of Research Scientist at Virginia Tech's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research interests include the creation and enhancement of statistical and machine learning-based solutions for issues including information retrieval, modeling, clustering, and recognition. The area of bioinformatics research is where I'm currently employed. In this regard, I focused on unsupervised deconvolution of diverse datasets using Convex Analysis of Mixtures, usage of the cosine-based one-sample test (COT) to identify marker genes among distinct subtypes, and missing data imputation in proteomics data. In a previous work, I investigated a range of machine learning and deep learning models for a number of applications, including speaker identification, brain fingerprinting, clustering, and prediction of solar radiation. I am a Postdoc from Virginia Tech University in the United States and hold M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in instrumentation engineering from Panjab University in Chandigarh and the Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University in New Delhi, respectively.

Publications and other Research Outputs International Journals: International Conferences EDUCATION AND RESEARCH Apr 2020 - May 2020 (Offline, USA) May 2020 - Nov 2021 (Online, India) Nov 2021 - Apr 2022 (Offline, USA) Virginia Tech University,Virginia, USA The Bradley Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering Visiting Researcher (Computational Bioinformatics and Bio-Imaging Laboratory) Research Domain: Bioinformatics Projects: 1. Unsupervised deconvolution of different datasets using improved Convex Analysis of Mixtures (CAM) Aims: To detect latent sources, their respective source signature genes/metabolites, and their relevant concentration patterns between healthy control and patients for the following datasets: CAD GWAS metabolomic datasets (‘Mesa’ and ‘Rotterdam’), GPAA proteomics and GPAA RNAseq Methods: - Two-step data normalization using Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) and Tag Count Comparison (TCC) Based Normalization. - Metabolomic data deconvolution by CAM 3.0 - Data visualization through heatmaps and simplex plots Result: We successfully identified several sources within and between different groups of data and their corresponding distinct and common source signature genes/metabolites in different datasets. 2.Missing data imputation of different datasets Aims: To impute the missing values for the Fresh frozen LAD45, AA paired Trizol data and for the LAD Trizol data. Further to do the comparative analysis of different missing data imputation methods. Methods: - The various methods used for comparison are Mean, non-linear estimation by iterative partial least squares (NIPALS), singular value thresholding (SVT), and Fused Regularization Matrix factorization (FRMF). 3.Application of Cosine-based One-sample Test (COT) to detect marker genes among many subtypes Aims: To enhance COT for downregulated signature genes (DSGs) along with upregulated expressed genes (SGs). COT based detection of both condition-specific SGs and DSGs for the following datasets: GPAA RNAseq, GPAA proteomics, Edinburgh Methods: - Two-step data normalization using Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) and Tag Count Comparison (TCC) Based Normalization. - COT enhancement for downregulated expressed genes. - Data visualization through updated heatmaps for multi-groups and simplex plots Feb 2020 – Apr 2020 (Offline, USA) Virginia Tech University,Virginia, USA The Bradley Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering Visiting Researcher (Deep Learning Research Laboratory) Projects: 1. Integrating of information set theory with deep learning principle to Improve Noisy Pattern Classification Aims: To address the critical problem of the absence of robust deep learning models, we propose Information-Set Deep learning (ISDL) architectures with four variants by integrating information set theory and deep learning principle. Methods: - Infor-Set Based Convolutional Neural Network - Infor-Set based Deep Feedforward Network - Infor-Set based neural network layer - Infor-Set based Pooling Layer Results: The experimental results show that the ISDL models can efficiently handle noise-dominated uncertainty and outperform peer architectures. July 2013 Delhi University,New Delhi, India Netaji Subhas Institute Of Technology (NSIT) PhD (Instrumentation and Control Engineering) § Thesis: System Identification & Control using Hybrid Combination of Statistical & Soft-Computing Techniques § Projects: 1.Text Independent Speaker Identification Aims: The aim of this project is to develop robust speaker recognition models. For this I developed three approaches. Methods: In the first approach, the HMM is utilized for the extraction of pattern similarity-based batch feature vector that is fitted with the GFM to identify the speaker. In the second approach, the equivalence between the defuzzified output of the GFM and the conditional mean of the GMM under certain conditions is used for the identification of speakers. In this the parameters of the GFM are calculated with the help of GMM. Finally, the third method has been inspired by the way humans cash in on the mutual acquaintances while identifying a speaker. In this, several sets of HMM models are created with different initial parameters such as the number of states and the number of Gaussian mixtures. 2.Pattern Similarity Based Clustering Aims: Two-pattern similarity-based techniques have been developed for the clustering of data. It is shown that the distance functions are not always adequate for clustering of data and strong correlations may still exist among the data vectors even if they are far apart from each other Methods: - Shape Based Batching - Shape Based Clustering Results: This method is tested on real (Iris data and signature data) as well as on the synthetic dataset. The results of simulation are very encouraging; the method gives 100% accuracy on Iris dataset and signature dataset while about 99% accuracy is obtained on the synthetic data 3.Time Series Prediction Aims: To predict the chaotic time series data. Methods:The underlying hidden properties of time series are captured with the help of HMM. The prediction method used here exploits the pattern identification prowess of the HMM for cluster selection in conjunction with the generalization and nonlinear modeling capabilities of soft-computing methods to predict the output of the system. Result:Accurately predicted the following time series data: 1. Mackey-Glass time series 2. Sunspot Data Time Series 3. Laser Data time Series 4. Lorenz Data Time Series 4.Solar Radiation Estimation Aims:To use machine learning techniques for solar radiation estimation using meteorological data. Methods:Two GFM based methods are used for the estimation of solar radiation. In the first method, pattern similarity-based clustering algorithm is utilized for the extraction of shape-based clusters from the input meteorological parameters and it is then processed by the GFM to estimate the solar radiation. The second model makes use of both the probability theory and fuzzy set theory for the estimation of radiation.
